NEPA, the good parts!

## Issues
> "...an issue is a point of disagreement, debate, or dispute with a proposed action based on some anticipate environmental effect...An issue: 1) has a cause and effect relationship with the proposed action or alternatives. 2) is within the scope of the analysis 3) has not been decided by law, regulation, or previous decision. 4) is amenable to scientific analysis rather than conjecture." **(BLM NEPA Handbook - Pg 40)**

Not everything brought up during scoping is an issue. Issues should be limited to:
>"Issue[s]...necessary to make a reasoned choice. [If it] is significant, or analysis is necessary to determine significance."
* "is there a disagreement about the best way to use a resource or resolve an unwanted resource condition."

**Example 1:** "What would be the effect of the alternatives on sage-grouse nesting?"
**Example 2:** "How will critical deer winter range be affected by the Proposed Action and Alternatives?"

### Identification of Issues
Schema for identifying true issues:
1. Write out a project description
2. List all Actions
3. Identify the potential impacts from the actions.  Any impacts previously address through:
  1. Prior routine analysis
  2. Design features or applicant committed measures
  3. Planned conditions of approval or mitigation
4. Preliminary issues = remaining unaddressed potentially significant impacts.

### Issue Identification and Analysis Method
For each issue with a potential impact positive or negative, complete a worksheet. If the issue/resource is not present or present but would not be impacted, a worksheet does not need to be completed.

For this worksheet, start at the beginning of the page and work your way down in order. Once the worksheet is completed, create an outline for your impact analysis and conduct the analysis based on the methodology you just outlined.

1. Proposed Action
2. Impact-Causing Element (ICE)
3. Resource Characteristic
4. Issue Statement
5. Design Features/SOP/BMPs
6. Methods:
  * Impact indictor
  * Analysis Area Geographic and Temporal
  * Assumptions
  * Data

Might be good to make a spreadsheet with all issues including categories for each one of the above stuff.

### Issue/Impact Analysis
1. Identify Potential impact-causing elements of project alternatives.
2. Remember impacts to both structure and function.
3. Use impact analysis planning to determine the impact indicator that will be used to describe the affected environment and environmental consequences for each issue.
  * Impact indicators are an element or quality that can be used as currency to describe the affected environment in preparation for assessing project impacts. Preferably quantitative, but can be qualitative.

**Some pointers for analysis:**
* Affected Environment and Environmental Consequences (and cumulative to some degree) sections should match each other in scope and detail.
* Impact analysis indicators should be used to quantify both the affected environmental and environmental consequences.
* Assumptions can be made, but provide rationale for those assumptions.

**The Steps:**
1. Summarize the impact-causing element ("*extending the runway would require dredge and fill of wetlands*")
2. Provide a qualitative description of the impact. ("*this impact would include surface disturbance, dredging, and re-routing of surface hydrological connections; all of which would affect wetland function, etc.*")
3. Give a measurement of the level of impact using the appropriate indicator ("*this would cause the loss of 40 acres of functioning wetlands habitat*")
4. Establish the context of that impact. ("*this 40 acres represents 30 percent of the available wetlands habitat if the project area in 2 percent of the wetlands habitat in the region.*")
  * Provide analytical conclusion interpreting the results. ("*the dredge and full of the 40 acres of wetlands habitat represents a complete loss of these resources in terms of structure and function. However, because these wetlands and hydrologicaly isolated, their loss would not impact other wetlands in the project area or the region.*")
5. Copmare the action alternative impacts to the No Action Alternative ("*This would impact 40 more acres of wetlands habitat than the No Action Alternative*")

Making a spreadsheet with all of these steps can be helpful for more complex projects.

## Tiering and Incorporate by Reference

**Tiering:** is using the coverage of general matters in a broader NEPA documents in subsequent narrower NEPA documents.
**Incorporate by Reference:**  "Agencies shall incorporate material...when the effect will be to cut down on bulk without impeding agency and public review of the action."

Both processes take two steps:
1. **Cite** the source of the incorporated material.
2. **Summarize** the incorporated material.

## Scoping
1. Group and lump issues.
2. Look at impact causing elements (ICE) that are relevant to each group.
3. Impact characteristic.

## Resources
### Good Examples
* [Pollyanna 8 Coal Lease Modification Application]({{"notes/assets/nepa/20171218_EA_Pollyanna8_FINAL_508CB.pdf"| relative_url}}). This document demonstrates:
  - Good Purpose and Need
  - Good Issue Identification
    - In the issues, they have an impact indicator tells you how they are going to measure the impacts.
  - Ok rationale for dismissing Issues
  - Only 25 pages
  - Good use of tables

### Tools
* [Impact Analysis Spreadsheet (.xls)]({{"notes/assets/nepa/Impact_Analysis_Plan_Worksheet.xlsm" | relative_url}})
