## Issues
> "...an issue is a point of disagreement, debate, or dispute with a proposed action based on some anticipate environmental effect...An issue: 1) has a cause and effect relationship with the proposed action or alternatives. 2) is within the scope of the analysis 3) has not been decided by law, regulation, or previous decision. 4) is amenable to scientific analysis rather than conjecture." **(BLM NEPA Handbook - Pg 40)**

Not everything brought up during scoping is an issue. Issues should be limited to:
>"Issue[s]...necessary to make a reasoned choice. [If it] is significant, or analysis is necessary to determine significance."
* "is there a disagreement about the best way to use a resource or resolve an unwanted resource condition."

**Example 1:** "What would be the effect of the alternatives on sage-grouse nesting?"
**Example 2:** "How will critical deer winter range be affected by the Proposed Action and Alternatives?"

### Identification of Issues
**Preliminary**
Start broad: what are all of the issues from internal and external sources.
Then go through your issues and:
* are some issues non-substantive?
* do additional substantive issues come out?
* Which are issues we need to analyze?
* Which issues can we address with design criteria?




## Tiering and Incorporate by Reference

**Tiering:** is using the coverage of general matters in a broader NEPA documents in subsequent narrower NEPA documents.
**Incorporate by Reference:**  "Agencies shall incorporate material...when the effect will be to cut down on bulk without impeding agency and public review of the action."

Both processes take two steps:
1. **Cite** the source of the incorporated material.
2. **Summarize** the incorporated material.
