I only took one statistics class in college.  It wasn't that great.  I remember the teacher telling a student that it wasn't her problem if the student didn't understand the material.  Needless to say, statistics found in most wildlife papers are way over my head. Time to change that.

I by no means am going to go over everything here.  I just want to have a good enough understanding that I can run my own stats.

## P-value
A low p-value indicates that there is strong evidence that the null hypothesis is rejected. Typically the threshold is < 0.05 (less than 0.05).  

So what does it mean to reject the null hypothesis?  When a p-value is presented you are usually comparing two populations to see if they are different.  Usually, the assumption that they are different is your hypothesis.  Your null hypothesis, therefore, is the opposite of your hypothesis. The opposite of them being different is, them being the same.  

In laymen's terms we can say that a low p-value means that it is unlikely that the two populations that we are comparing are the same.

## Regression
