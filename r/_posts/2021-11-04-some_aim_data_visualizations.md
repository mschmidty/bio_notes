I don't really put a lot of what I do at work here.  I try to keep work at work and a lot of what I post here is for fun.  But sometimes when I want to think through something at work or need to learn something at work and writing it down helps me remember or think about it I do post it here.  Lately though, I've been producing some visualizations from [Assessment Inventory and Monitoring (AIM)](https://aim.landscapetoolbox.org/) data that I think are worth sharing.  

## Species Richness

As part of the AIM protocol we try to identify every plant that occurs at each plot.  The first visualization is a column plot of the percentage of vegetation sites that a species of each plant is identidfied at, separated by strata.
