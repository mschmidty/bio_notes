Similar to my post last week, we are again looking at another AIM data analysis.  The last analysis was created from the raw AIM dataset kept in ESRI Collector. This time we are pulling the data from the SQL database that houses the QA/QC'd final dataset.  This is also an analysis that uses data outside of our field office.
