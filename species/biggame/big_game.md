PLoS ONE 11(12): e0167259. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0167259 | inter-national | multiple | multiple | multiple | Systematic review of 274 peer-reviewed articles on recreation impacts (1981 to present).   Found non-motorized and winter terrestrial recreation activities had most evidence of negative effects on wildlife.  Most commot mitigation recommendation was spatial restrictions on trail development, followed by education, caps on use, and temporal restrictions. |

Ecology andSociety 16(3): 16. http://dx.doi.org/10.5751/ES-04251-160316 | Banff, Kootenay and Yoho National Parks, Canada | not-specified | elk, wolf | Trail and road use | Elk responded to increasing trail activity, avoiding areas 51-400m from trails when trail activity reached 1-2 users/hr.  Elk avoiding using areas 401-800m when trail activity reached ~12 users/hr.  Wolves responded similarly, avoiding areas 0-800m from trails as trail activity increased.  Wolf response to trail activity leveled off at ~30-40 users/hr. |

J., technical editor, The Starkey Project: a synthesis of long-term studies of elk and mule deer. Reprinted from the 2004 Transactions of the North American Wildlife and Natural Resources Conference, Alliance Communications Group, Lawrence, Kansas, USA. | Oregon, USA | not-specified | elk, mule deer | ATV, Mtn Bike, Hiker, Horseback | The probability of an elk fleeing each activity was greater than 50% at <400m (ATV), <200m (MTB), and 100m or less (foot and horseback).  Movemet rates for elk during flight were greatest for ATV, second highest for MTB, and lowest during hiking and horseback riding (speed effect?).  Movement rates for elk were substantially higher during morning than afternoon disturbance periods.  Note that movement rates for elk were higher during dawn and dusk during disturbance trials (even though not disturbance occured at these times) suggesting that displaced elk had to return to optimal foraging/resting locations post-disturbance.  Mule deer did not exhibit same flight response and showed little measurable response to treatments. |

Journal of Wildlife Management, 73(3):328-338.Published By: The Wildlife Societyhttps://doi.org/10.2193/2008-102 | Oregon, USA | Ponderosa forest/grassland mosaic | elk | ATV, Mtn Bike, Hiker, Horseback | More in depth analysis of potential foraging time implications treatments conducted by Wisdom et. al 2005.  Similar results to 2005 paper, but added that elk likely responded less to afternoon treatments due to morning movements away from disturbance transects.  Also noted that despite treatment type (ATV, MTB, hiker or horseback) elk returned to pre-disturbance activity levels 1-2 hrs after treatment.  Noted that elk did not appear to habituate to disturbance from MTBs or hikers.  Observed decreased time spend foraging and resting for all disturbance types. |

Biolgical Conservation  141 (2008) 2159-2173 | inter-national | varied | ungulates | varied | Found greater flight distance when approach appeared more threatening (faster, more direct).  Weak correlation between larger group size and increased flight distance.  Found individuals in open habitats had increased flight distance than those in more wooded habitats.  Humans on foot off trail had greater response than predicatable on trail or vehicle use.  Weak habituation response in areas with increased human exposure. |

Ecological Applications, Vol 13, No. 4 (Aug., 2003) pp. 951-963 | Utah, un-hunted preserve | Sagebrush grassland/small stands of juniper | bison, mule deer, pronghorn | hiking, mtn bike | Did not distinguish different response between hikers and mtb.  All species showed greater flight distance when recreationists were above them vs. below.  Distance moved when disturbed were greater in the morning than evening.  Larger group size also increased response to disturbance.  Mule deer showed 96% probability of flushing from trail use within 100m.   Probability of flight response did not drop below 70% until distance from trail > 390m.  Mean flight distance from trail use was 151m.  Off trail recreationist caused increased response compared to on trail use. |

(Spring, 1986), pp. 63-68. | Middle Park, Colorado | Sagebrush high elevation winter range with slopes and ridges | mule deer | snowshoes, snowmobiling | Found that deer response was greater to foot traffic than snowmobiles.  Suggested that preventing flight response would require persons on foot to stay >191 m from mule deer (>133m for snowmobiles).  Minimizing all impacts to mule deer would require persons afoot and snowmobiles to remain > 334m and > 470m respectively. |

PLoS ONE 7(11): e50611.10.1371/journal.pone.0050611 | Alberta, Canada | Ag grasslands intermixed with mountains and conifer forests | elk | foot, horseback, mtn bike, atv and vehicle traffic | Found that human activities and distance to tree cover accounted for increased vigilance behavior in elk more than predation in studied landscape.  Elk w/in 500 m of roads increased vigilance (reduced feeding time) when road/trail traffic increased to 1 vehicle every 2 hrs (12 vehicles/day).   Motorized vehicles (trucks, ATV, moto) had stronger impact than non-moto (hikers, bikers, equestrians), but hikers caused increase flight distance and travel time.  Overall, ATVs exceeded all other disturbance types triggering increased vigilance behavior in elk. |

Ecosphere 4(3):32. http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/ES12-00286.1 | Oregon, USA | Ponderosa forest/ grassland mosaic | elk | ATV, Mtn Bike, Hiker, Horseback | Used potential functions to analyze experimental disturbance of elk from different types of trail use.  Found that elk demonstrated strong avoidance of ATVs out to 1km, mtn bikes out to 500m, and foot and horseback out to 200m. |
