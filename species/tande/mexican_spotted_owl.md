## Basic Information
### Status
806 Pairs at time of listing in 1993.
### Range - Important for Southwest Colorado Only
No known populations in southwest Colorado. However, populations occur in Moab, Utah and outside of canyon city.

Surveys have been conducted since the late 1980s.  No nests have been confirmed, although several detections have occurred.
### Habitat
Primarily mixed conifer dominated by Douglas-fir, pine, or true fir (Abies) and pine-oak forests.  Secondarily, steep, narrow canyons with cliffs and perennial water source.
### Threats
Loss of habitat owing to clear felling of forests, and degradation of habitat owing to even-aged tree management, have been primary threats to Spotted Owl.
### Conservation Actions
Better timber management.
