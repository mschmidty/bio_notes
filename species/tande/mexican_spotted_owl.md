## Basic Information

### Status
806 Pairs at time of listing in 1993.

### Range - Important for Southwest Colorado Only
No known populations in southwest Colorado. However, populations occur in Moab, Utah and outside of canyon city.

Surveys have been conducted since the late 1980s.  No nests have been confirmed, although several detections have occurred.

### Habitat
Primarily mixed conifer dominated by Douglas-fir, pine, or true fir (Abies) and pine-oak forests.  Secondarily, steep, narrow canyons with cliffs and perennial water source.

### Threats
Loss of habitat owing to clear felling of forests, and degradation of habitat owing to even-aged tree management, have been primary threats to Spotted Owl.

### Conservation Actions
Better timber management.

## Detailed Information

### Impacts
#### Degradation of Habitat
Clear felling of forest and forest management that leads to single aged stands of forest is the primary threat to the species.  Forests that have been selectively logged (not clear cut) can be re-occupied within 40 to 100 years by MSO. 

#### Human Disturbance at Nest sites
Mexican spotted-owls do not appear to be impacted by direct human disturbance.  However, given the status of the species, it is common practice to limit disturbance during the breeding season, March 1 - Aug 31, within 1/2 mile of any nest.
