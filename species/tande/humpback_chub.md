## Basic Information
### Status
Total adult population size is not precisely known but appears to be roughly 10,000 (see USFWS 2011).
### Range - Important for Southwest Colorado Only
Colorado River.  Depletions due to oil and gas are the only real concern to habitat.
### Threats
Loss, fragmentation, and modification of habitat through impoundment (e.g., stream inundation, reduced water temperatures, reduced spring flows, and increased daily fluctuation in flows, resulting from construction and operation of Hoover Dam, Glen Canyon Dam, and Flaming Gorge Dam); introduced competitors and predators; and hybridization with Gila elegans and G. robusta.
### Conservation Actions
1. Resolve taxonomic problems in Colorado River basin Gila.
2. Identify and define Humpback Chub populations.
3. Implement monitoring programs.
4. Investigate the life history and ecological requirements of Humpback Chub.
5. Protect Humpback Chub populations and their habitats.
6. Assess potential reintroduction or augmentation sites and implement stocking when deemed necessary and feasible.
7. Promote and encourage improved communication and information dissemination.
8. Determine biological criteria/objectives for downlisting/delisting the Humpback Chub.
