## Basic Information
### Status
This species is represented by just a few extant spawning populations. Total adult population size appears to be not more than a few thousand (perhaps fewer than or not many more than 5,000).  - [IUCN Red List](https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/23162/19032625#geographic-range)

### Range - Important for Southwest Colorado Only
Colorado River and San Juan River.

### Threats
Threats to the species include streamflow regulation, habitat modification, competition with and predation by non-native fish species, and pesticides and pollutants (USFWS 2002).

Recruitment is very low (or absent) despite spawning and hatched larvae (e.g., in upper Green River basin). Low recruitment results primarily from predation on larvae and juveniles by introduced fishes (Marsh et al. 2003). Competition with and predation by exotic crayfish may also be a problem in some areas (Lenon et al. 2002).

### Conservation Actions
Population maintenance depends on ongoing stocking of juveniles that are large enough to avoid predation by non-native fishes.

Natural recruitment might be enhanced by appropriate management of floodplains that serve as important nursery areas
