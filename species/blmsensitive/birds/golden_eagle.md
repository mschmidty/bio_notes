# Habitat
## Breeding

*Excerpts from: [Birds of North America from the Cornel Lab of Ornithology](https://birdsna.org/Species-Account/bna/species/goleag/introduction)*

Breeds in open and semiopen habitats from near sea level to 3,630 m (Poole and Bromley 1988a, G. R. Craig pers. comm.)—tundra, shrublands, grasslands, woodland-brushlands, and coniferous forests (Kochert 1986). Also in farmland and riparian habitats (Kochert 1972, Menkens and Anderson 1987). Avoids heavily forested areas.
Occurs primarily in mountainous canyon land, rimrock terrain of open desert and grassland areas of w. U.S. Also nests extensively in riparian habitats in e. Great Plains (Menkens and Anderson 1987) and occasionally in forested areas.
Typically forages in open habitats: grasslands or steppelike vegetation.

## Winter Range

From Root 1988b and others as noted. Primarily Humid Temperate and Dry ecoregion domains (Bailey 1989a) from s. Alaska and Canada to central Mexico. Frequents areas in w. North America >457 m in elevation and winters up to 2,500 m (e.g., San Luis Valley, CO). Generally absent from harsh, dry areas (<20 cm annual precipitation) of Sonoran Desert and central Nevada; does not winter in western temperate forests in and west of Rocky Mtns.

Across w. U.S., prefers open habitats with native vegetation and avoids urban, agricultural, and forested areas (Millsap 1981, Fischer et al. 1984, Craig et al. 1986, Marzluff et al. 1997b). Uses sagebrush communities, riparian areas, grasslands, and rolling oak savanna (Knight et al. 1979, Fischer et al. 1984, Hayden 1984, Estep and Sculley 1989). In sw. Idaho, forages primarily in shrubland and avoids grassland and agriculture, with foraging points concentrated in sagebrush/rabbitbrush (Chrysothamnus spp.) habitat and cliff areas (Marzluff et al. 1997b). Common in grazed areas; much remaining habitat in central and s. California in patches of relatively inaccessible mountainous country, primarily livestock ranches (Thelander 1974).

Common near reservoirs and wildlife refuges that provide foraging opportunities at winter waterfowl concentrations in midwestern U.S. (Wingfield 1991). Associated with riverine or wetland systems east of Mississippi River (Millsap and Vana 1984). Most sightings in e. U.S. concentrated within or along southwestern border of the Appalachian Plateau (30% of records) and within the Coastal Plain physiographic region (33% of records). Associated with steep river valleys, reservoirs, and marshes in inland areas; estuarine marshlands, barrier islands, managed wetlands, sounds, and mouths of major river systems in coastal areas. These wetlands are attractive due to a dominance of open vegetation, large concentrations of prey, and absence of human disturbance. Winters on montane grass and heath balds in the Appalachian Plateau region (Millsap and Vana 1984).

## Affected Environment
### Eagle Nest Site Disturbance
Golden eagles are long lived species and maintain nesting territories for generations, with territories being occupied for a century or longer. Territories with little disturbance and sufficient prey populations can be occupied by successive generations of eagles (Palmer 1988).

Golden eagles appear to be sensitive to human activity. Steidle et. al. (1993) found when observers were camped 400m (1300 ft or 1/4 mile) for 24 hours from golden eagle nests, adults spent less time near their nests, fed juveniles less frequently, and fed themselves and their juveniles up to 67% less food than when observers were camped 800m (2600 ft or 1/2 mile) away from nests for an equal period of time. In studies of golden eagle populations in the southwest (New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming), D'Ostilo (1954),Camenzind (1969), and Boeker and Ray (1971) reported that some form of human disturbance accounted for 45-85% of all known nest losses. Watson et al. (2010) found golden eagles were less likely to occur near human disturbance. Kaisanlahti-Jokimaki et al. (2008) documented lower territory occupancy rates near tourist communities. In Idaho, a study of 40 years of golden eagle territory data showed that areas that experienced OHV use saw a substantial decrease in nest productivity when compared with nests that had less OHV activity . Nests that were near parking lots (<700m) were particularly affected, some not producing young for up to 15 years (Steenhof et al. 2014). Kochert (U.S.G.S, unpublished data) observed that territories that experienced disturbance, that became vacant, did so after at least one and sometimes several years of breeding failures. Eagles also do not frequently abandon nests once they become unsuitable for raising young because it is common that nest site alternatives do not exist.

### Recommendations for Protection Golden Eagle Reproduction
Nest site timing limitations and/or disturbance buffers are commonly used to prevent nest site disturbance. Colorado Parks and Wildlife (CPW) and research by Steidle et. al. (1993) recommends a no disturbance buffer of 1/2 mile. Exactly how much disturbance would likely lead to decreased productivity or territory failure is not known. Typically the most reasonable management for eagles is to limit disturbance to the greatest extent possible to ensure adequate available nesting territories and successful reproduction.

The Tres Rios Field Office RMP (2015), Colorado Parks and Wildlife (2008), the US Fish and Wildlife Service Utah Field Office Guidelines (2002) and Suter (1981) all recommend ½ mile buffer no disturbance buffers around golden eagle nests during the breeding season.

### Habituation to Human Disturbance
Some literature tries to address the possibility that golden eagles can habituate to human disturbance (Romin and Muck, 2002). Unlike bald eagles (Guinn 2004) no research has shown that golden eagles regularly habituate to disturbance, but in some cases it does occur.

Behavior varies among individuals and at what level disturbance will impact eagles is difficult to determine based on variation in individual and environmental factors. It should also be noted that what is perceived as habituation to human activity, such as a bird nesting near disturbance, may still be increasing stress and result in decreased productivity. Steenhof et al. studied eagles and found that once disturbed a pair of eagles did not abandon their territory (apparent habituation), but the pair did not successfully produce young for 15 years (2014).

### Summary Golden Eagle Disturbance Information
Golden eagles are susceptible to human disturbance and disturbance can lead to reproductive failure, death of young or reproductive discouragement. One half mile, no disturbance buffers around active nests are commonly used to limit disturbance and insure nest success.
