The bald eagle is the national emblem of the United States and is one of the most studied birds in the world.  The species has recovered from near extinction in the mid-1900s due to ingestion of the pesticide DDT weakening the shells of their eggs. The species was listed under the endangered species act in 1978. Since the decline of the use of DDT in 1980, Bald Eagles have recovered dramatically.

## Threats
Threats that affect bald eagles are: shooting and trapping; pesticides and other contaminates and toxins; ingestion of plastics, lead, etc.; collision with stationary/moving structures or objects; fishing nets; degradation of habitat: breeding and wintering; disturbance at nest and roost sites; and human/research impacts.  Currently hunting and shooting is the most significant source of mortality for bald eagles. Historically, pesticide ingestion was major factor in the decline and federal protection of the species. Ingestion of lead is also a significant cause of mortality.

Land managers have the ability to affect the degradation of habitat and disturbance at nest and roost sites.  The following is a discussion of those impacts.
