The bald eagle is the national emblem of the United States and is one of the most studied birds in the world.  The species has recovered from near extinction in the mid-1900s due to ingestion of the pesticide DDT weakening the shells of their eggs. The species was listed under the endangered species act in 1978. Since the decline of the use of DDT in 1980, Bald Eagles have recovered dramatically.

## Threats
Threats that affect bald eagles are: shooting and trapping; pesticides and other contaminates and toxins; ingestion of plastics, lead, etc.; collision with stationary/moving structures or objects; fishing nets; degradation of habitat: breeding and wintering; disturbance at nest and roost sites; and human/research impacts.  Currently hunting and shooting is the most significant source of mortality for bald eagles. Historically, pesticide ingestion was major factor in the decline and federal protection of the species. Ingestion of lead is also a significant cause of mortality.

Land managers have the ability to affect the degradation of habitat and disturbance at nest and roost sites.  The following is a discussion of those impacts.

### Degradation of Habitat: Breeding and Wintering
Human development disturbs bald eagles. Developments can be buildings or structures or roads with human recreation access points. Eagles respond to development by avoiding developed areas for nesting, roosting and perching/foraging.  Repeated persistent disturbance may lead to abandonment of otherwise suitable habitat. It is unknown if human presence or developmental structures are avoided by bald eagles. It is thought that disturbance reduces carrying capacity through the reduction in adequate suitable habitat.

Tolerance of disturbance varies widely. Eagles that experience human persecution may be less tolerant of human disturbance. If eagle persecution is reduced, eagles may begin to select habitats with more human activity.

### Disturbance at Nest and Roost Sites



* Because of wide range in tolerance, difficult to develop management strategies that accommodate needs of sensitive individuals without appearing overly protective of population at large.

This section discusses human disturbance, defined as any human activity that induces change in eagle behavior, and not habitat degradation as discussed above (admittedly the distinction between the two is small). Eagles are disturbed by the following activities:
* human presence
* human recreation(hunting, hiking, fishing, boating, bird watching, off-road vehicles)
* research activities
* noise from various sources (e.g. weapons testing, air craft)
* forestry activities
* agricultural activities (e.g. plowing disking, planting)
* construction activities

Humans on foot, generally, evoke the strongest response from bald eagles. Disturbance result in greater impact as the duration of the disturbance increases.

Eagles response varies by individual and by disturbance.  Disturbances range from temporary agitation, to flushing of individuals from perches, roost sites, foraging areas, or nest sites, to permanent displacement from otherwise suitable habitat.

The result of disturbance also varies. Disturbance can result in increased energetic demands, which may reducing survival, especially during winter if food and quality foraging are limited. At nest sites, nest abandonment or nest failure may occur.  It is not thought that nest disturbance results affect populations.

Again their is a wide range of responses to disturbance by individuals and populations. Several flushing studies have tested this assertion. Responses are thought to be heavily influenced by bald eagle persecution.  But this assertion is untested. It is important to remember that in general eagles avoid areas with human activity and human disturbance may reduce the amount of adequate nesting, roosting and foraging habitats available.
